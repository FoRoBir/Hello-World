# Hello-World
And we're off...

A bit about me. My name is Forrest. I'm a middle aged dude in America that has decided to change careers and am building my way up to noob from nowhere. I've been self employed in the construction industry for years and would like to work more with my brain and less with my deteriorating braun, So, I've decided I am going to be a freelance web and software developer. This is step one of the millions I anticipate on my new adventure. I don't believe in luck, but positive vibes and constructive criticism are always welcome.
